# 🐾 HappyPaws

🐾 HappyPaws is a simple backend project built with MongoDB, Node.js, and Express to practice CRUD operations.
It simulates a Pet Adoption System, where pets can be added, viewed, updated, and removed from the database.

### ✨ The goal is to provide a hands-on learning project while creating something fun and meaningful — giving every paw a chance to find a happy home.
